Originally from Trinidad, she completed her BA at the Rhode Island School of Design and then moved to Houston, Texas to pursue an MFA at the University of Houston. Zoya first opened her gallery in 2009 at a location on Milam Street in Midtown and eventually moved to a space at 4411 Montrose. In 2013, she and her husband designed a beautiful new gallery space on Fannin Street. They did business there for 3 years, until Zoya’s life took an unexpected turn. In 2017, she had two twin girls and she became a private art dealer based out of her art studio on the 4th floor of her home. In addition to honing her own artistic practice, she also sells works by artists from all over the US and manages her late husband’s estate. Today, Zoya continues to enjoy working with clients and collectors to help them find pieces that suit their needs for art in their lives."})]})]})]})}},9008:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n(4605)}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=512)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
